# Map-Representation-Grid-Graph-

Discretizing (tiling) the input map into a grid graph, and fast finding shortest path between points 

It might be useful for the people who are working in robotic area or artificial intelligence
it contains: tiling or discretizing the input map, path planning (shortest path)
sparse grid graph etc.

 The main function converts (discretizes) an input image (.png, .jpg, .bmp) into a grid
 graph (grid cells) in a shape of sparse matrix. Furthure, dijkstra algorithm is
 applied to find the shortest path between points.
 To consider the neighboir cellls, 8 connectivity is used:
 
%------------------------------------------------

 Graph=CreateGraph (filename,drate,showflag)

 ** filename is the black-white input image file with size 'n*m', black
 points are obstacles (there won't be any node over those cells) and white ones are
 free space,

 ** drate is the discretization ratio (cell or tile size), if we set this rate to 1, for each
 pixel in the image we will have a node in the graph.  

 ** showflag, is to show the output image 
 the output graph is saced as sparse matrix
 the nodes are presented in a 1D vector, thus a 'k' biy'l' matrix is shown by a vecotr with 'k*l' cells: [row 1, row 2,... row k]
 
 the reference frame (0,0) in the image is considered in left-up
 
 
 You can start to run 'test1.m' or 'test2.m'
